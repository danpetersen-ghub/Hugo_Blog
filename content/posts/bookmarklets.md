# Bookmarks and JavaScript.

For a while now its been extremely useful to extract data from a webpage via the console. 

Until recently I had to go in the the arduous process of opening the dev tools, tabbing to console, then inserting code. 

Very...very..slow!

So, it turns out its really easy to save these little javascript snippets as bookmarks then with one click, BAM, the code is run in the page. Great! 👍
