# NodeJS Starter App

URL: TBC

### TechStack:

* NodeJS
* Express
* MySQL

### Languages/Syntax:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* SQL

### Features:

* Database
* Create/Read Records
* Basic Auth
* API

### Why?

I didn't want to go straight into a generic 'create-react-app' but I also seem to come up with ideas every few days, but the ambition is greater than the resources available to me! 

So I plan to use this starter as the base for any App I create in the future. 

I most likely will find a better nodeJS starter out in the web but this one has been great as a learning exercise. But...I must admit, harder and bigger than I thought!
